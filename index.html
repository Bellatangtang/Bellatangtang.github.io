					<h1 id="chapter1" class="page-header">1 Introduction</h1>
					<h3 id="section1.1">1.1 What is RED</h3>
					<p>RNA editing is one of the post- or co-transcriptional
						processes with modification of RNA nucleotides from their
						genome-encoded sequence. In human, RNA editing event occurs mostly
						by deamination of adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) conversion through
						ADAR enzymes.</p>
					<p>RED (RNA Editing Detector) is a program to detect and
						visualize RNA editing events at the genomic scale using
						next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. The software intergrates
						multiple steps to filter spurisous variant sites, and then
						performs formal statistical tests to identify reliable RNA editing
						sites. A potential RNA editing site can be visualized in the
						context of reference genome (/gene).</p>
					<img src="img/fig.1.1.png" alt="" height=640px width=960px />
					<p class="imgname">Fig. 1.1 A screen shot of RED</p>
					<p>RED is a Java-based program with Graphic User Interface
						(GUI), which works on mainstream operating systems (e.g., Windows,
						Linux and Mac OS X). To make it more efficient, everlasting and
						faster-saving, we use MySQL database managing system (DBMS) in
						manuplicating huge NGS data. In addition. In addition, we used
						functions in R (www.R-project.org) in performing statistical
						analysis. However, you'll never manipulate R and MySQL when you
						used RED program. All of the operation relative to R and MySQL is
						completed by RED automatically. RED enables the analysis of RNA
						editing events at two levels (illustrated below) using VCF files
						from different sources and the presentation of full mapped
						sequence data using BAM file:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Detection of RNA editing sites using RNA-seq data alone
							(i.e., De Novo identification)</li>
						<li>Detection of RNA editing events using both DNA-sequencing
							data (e.g., whole exome sequencing) and RNA-Seq data</li>
					</ul>
					<h3 id="section1.2">1.2 Prerequisites</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Java Runtime Environment (jdk 1.7.0_21 or later)</li>
						<li>MySQL Database Management System (MySQL 5.6.19 or later)</li>
						<li>R Environment (R 3.1.1 or later)</li>
					</ul>
					<h3 id="section1.3">1.3 Installation</h3>
					<h4>1.3.1 Install Java Runtime Environment</h4>
					<p>Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is basically the Java Virtual
						Machine (JVM) where your Java programs run on. It also includes
						browser plugins for Applet execution. Java Development Kit (JDK)
						is the full featured Software Development Kit (SDK) for Java,
						including JRE, and the compilers and tools (e.g., JavaDoc, and
						Java Debugger) to create and compile programs. In order to run
						RED, we need to install either JRE or JDK.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>JDK:</li>
						<p>
							<a href="URI">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html</a>
						</p>
						<li>JRE:</li>
						<p>
							<a href="URI">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html</a>
						</p>
					</ul>
					<h4>1.3.2 Install MySQL Database</h4>
					<p>RED stores all data into database so that we can reuse the
						data for research. MySQL is one of the best choice since it is
						free and efficient. Although default configuration in MySQL can
						ensure your server works well, you could edit the configure file
						to gain better performance. For Linux System, edit the parameters
						in the file of /etc/my.cnf (default configuration path). For
						Windows System, you could use MySQL Workbench to configure your
						server efficiently.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>MySQL:</li>
						<p>
							<a href="URI">http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/</a>
						</p>
					</ul>
					<h4>
						1.3.3 Install <i>R</i> Environment
					</h4>

					<p>R is a free software environment for statistical computing
						and graphics. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX
						platforms, Windows and MacOS. To download R, please choose your
						preferred CRAN mirror. The package of “rJava” in R is required,
						which ensures connection between R and Java. Open a R Window and
						type:</p>
					<p>
						<code>
							<i>install.packages(rJava)</i>
						</code>
					</p>
					<p>The package will be installed automatically with Internet
						connection.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>R:</li>
						<p>
							<a href="URI">http://www.r-project.org/</a>
						</p>
					</ul>
					<h3 id="section1.4">1.4 Terminology</h3>
					<p>There are a few terms used throughout the RED documentation
						which it is useful to understand before using the program.</p>
					<h4>1.4.1 Molecular Biology</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>RNA Editing</li>
						<p>RNA editing is one of the post- or co-transcriptional
							processes with modification of RNA nucleotides from their
							genome-encoded sequence.</p>
						<li>Reference Genome</li>
						<p>Reference genome is a comprehensive, integrated,
							non-redundant, well-annotated set of reference sequences
							including genomic, transcript, and protein (hg19).</p>
						<li>Sequence Alignment Map (<i>.bam/.sam</i>) File
						</li>
						<p>SAM format is a text format for storing sequence data in a
							series of tab delimited ASCII columns, while BAM format stores
							the same data in a compressed, indexed, binary form.</p>
						<li>Variant Calling Format (<i>.vcf</i>) File
						</li>
						<p>VCF is a text file format (most likely stored in a
							compressed manner) which contains meta-information lines, a
							header line, and then data lines each containing information
							about a position in the genome.</p>
					</ul>
					<h4>1.4.2 Program</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Data Set</li>
						<p>A data set stores a set of data, which is imported from a
							single file. It is an efficient way to be handled and presented.
							In program, a data set refers to a BAM/SAM file that contains
							sequence alignment/map information, which is displayed in the
							context of reference sequence.</p>
						<li>Data Group</li>
						<p>A data group contains two or more data sets with different
							biological conditions to make it compared for some purposes
							(e.g., comparing RNA editing sites identified in cancer tissues
							and adjacent normal tissues). In a given data group, we aggregate
							data sets needed for research and save the results of comparison.
							This function has not completely worked , and we will try our
							best to make it come true in the next version.</p>
						<li>Data Store</li>
						<p>A data store refers to either a data set or a data group.
							Most analyses and visualizations in RED operate on data stores
							and they work equally well with either data sets or data groups.</p>
						<li>Probe/ProbeBean</li>
						<p>
							A probe represents a potential RNA-editing site which contains
							basic information (e.g., coordinate, and editing base), while a
							probe bean contains all information derived from <i>.vcf</i>
							file.
						</p>
						<li>Probe Set</li>
						<p>A probe set stores all probes from an initial vcf file,
							namely stores all RNA-editing sites without using any filter. It
							is also the root of a pipeline tree when executing any filter to
							the original probe set. The probe set is produced when a vcf file
							has been input into database.</p>
						<li>Probe List</li>
						<p>A probe list is a subset of the probe set. Probe lists are
							generated by one or more filters implemented in RED, which store
							the remaining editing sites after filteration. However, we can
							produce probe lists from another probe list which had executed
							one or more filters.</p>
					</ul>

					<h1 id="chapter2" class="page-header">2 Getting Started</h1>
					<h3 id="section2.1">2.1 Starting a New Project</h3>
					<p>Before starting a new project, make sure that you have
						configured all running environments mentioned in the Prerequisites
						section. You can either select a genome or connect to MySQL
						database when starting a new project, but both should be performed
						to make the program work properly.</p>
					<h4>2.1.1 Select a Genome</h4>
					<p>
						To start a new project, you may first select a new genome of
						interest. When the program is open, select <i>File > New
							Project…</i> to select a new genome. If there isn't any genome file
						in the local host, a warning notification will pop up as the
						following illustrated and tell you what you should do.
					</p>
					<img src="/img/fig.2.1.png" alt="" height=148px width=762px>
					<p class="imgname">Fig. 2.1 Warning when there is no genome in
						genome directory</p>
					<p>If you choose to download a new genome, click Import New
						button and find out the new genome you need.</p>
					<img src="/img/fig.2.2.png" alt="" height=340px width=380px />
					<p class="imgname">Fig. 2.2 Select a new genome to download</p>
					<p>After the download completes, the following dialog of
						'Select Genome…' will pop up.</p>
					<img src="/img/fig.2.3.png" alt="" height=350px width=400px />
					<p class="imgname">Fig. 2.3 Select a new genome to import</p>
					<p>It is noteworthy that it may take a little bit longer when
						importing genome data into RED for the first time. We have a cache
						mechanism to make it faster when you reload the same genome. Once
						you have selected your genome and it has been loaded, you can move
						on to the next step.</p>
					<h4>2.1.2 Connecting to MySQL Database</h4>
					<p>
						A simple database connection dialog will pop up when you select <i>File
							> Connect to MySQL…</i> as the following illustrated.
					</p>
					<img src="/img/fig.2.4.png" alt="" height=300px width=300px />
					<p class="imgname">Fig. 2.4 Connect to MySQL DBMS</p>
					<p>With successful connection, the program will detect whether
						there is an database with imported data before and then make a
						relevant notification for the next step.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Null in Database</li>
						<p>If the database is empty (or null), the program will tell
							what you need to prepare for data import.</p>
						<img src="/img/fig.2.5.png" alt="" height=399px width=498px />
						<p class="imgname">Fig. 2.5 Data import notification</p>
						<img src="/img/fig.2.6.png" alt="" height=300px width=600px />
						<p class="imgname">Fig. 2.6 Data import dialog</p>
						<p>A simple explanation for each kind of importing file was
							shown. It helps you locate what kind of data file should be
							imported when you select browse button.</p>
						<img src="/img/fig.2.7.png" alt="" height=442px width=873px />
						<p class="imgname">Fig. 2.7 Importing data</p>
						<p>After all the paths have been selected, press Import button
							and wait for a moment, all the data will be imported to your
							database.</p>
						<li>Data Which Don't Meet Your Demand in Database</li>
						<p>
							After database is connected using database connection panel, <i>Fig.
								2.6</i> is present by selecting <i>File > Import Data >
								Database…</i> and you can import another data for further demand.
						</p>
						<li>Data Which Meets Your Demand in Database</li>
						<img src="/img/fig.2.8.png" alt="" height=300px width=300px />
						<p class="imgname">Fig. 2.8 Notification of successful
							database connection and data loaded to database</p>
						<p>If data have been loaded into database system, then you can
							filter spurisous variants for detecting potential RNA-editing
							sites.</p>
					</ul>
					<h4>2.1.3 Loading a BAM/SAM File (using both RNA-Seq and
						DNA-sequencing data; or only RNA-Seq data)</h4>
					<p>In order to make a full landscape of all potential
						RNA-editing sites at the genomic scale, the sequence alignment/map
						file (BAM/SAM), as well as variant calling format file (VCF),
						which has been imported to database, is needed. All potential
						RNA-editing sites will be shown in Chromosome Panel. The program
						only supports paired-end reads in the current release.</p>
					<p>The SAM/BAM format has been well defined in 1.4Terminology
						section. We provided an option dialog to help import BAM/SAM data
						so you don't need to specify much information.</p>
					<img src="/img/fig.2.9.png" alt="" height=280px width=300px />
					<p class="imgname">Fig. 2.9 An option dialog for importing
						BAM/SAM file</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Remove duplicate reads</li>
						<p>Removing duplicate reads (reads of the same length and
							sequence identity) is a widely used practice to correct bias when
							analyzing NGS data. Tick if you want to remove. We strongly
							recommend you remove them because it may influence the result of
							coverage.</p>
						<li>Minimal mapping quality</li>
						<p>Control the minimum mapping quality when importing data.
							You can choose to filter some reads in Chromosome Panel when
							importing data based on their mapping quality scores. The quality
							score ranges from 0 to 255 (with higher scores being better), and
							if you set a filter value then only mapped reads with a score
							above this value will be imported. Not all read mappers will
							include a score value so depending on where the file you are
							importing came from this option may have no effect.</p>
					</ul>
					<h4>2.1.4 Setting filters</h4>
					<p>Eight kinds of filters have been provided in RED, see
						Filters section for more detail. Before setting filters, database
						must be connected successfully. An initial set of RNA-editing
						sites(ProbeSet) will be present as a root tree named All Probes
						within Directory Panel. When one filter is executed, a leaf
						connected to this tree will be generated associated with the
						remaining RNA-editing sites.</p>
					<p>For the tested data, we have imported BJ22.RNA.chr8.snvs.vcf
						and BJ22.RNA.chr8.snvs.bam file into database which has 9530
						candidate RNA-editing sites.</p>
					<img src="/img/fig.2.10.png" alt="" height=189px width=274px />
					<p class="imgname">Fig. 2.10 RNA-seq data and potential RNA
						editing sites within Directory Panel</p>
					<p>Then we execute the Basic Filter with quality greater than
						20 and coverage greater than 6.</p>
					<img src="/img/fig.2.11.png" alt="" / height=250px width=400px>
					<p class="imgname">Fig. 2.11 Basic Filter options</p>
					<p>After filteration (for a few seconds), there is a subset of
						editing sites remained and a leaf will be produced within
						Directory Panel to describe and check what you have filtered out
						as illustrated below. At the same time, the Genome Panel and
						Chromosome Panel will present the RNA-editing sites by different
						colours.</p>
					<img src="/img/fig.2.12.png" alt="" height=120px width=276px />
					<p class="imgname">Fig. 2.12 After executing basic filter, a
						probe list is generated</p>
					<h4>2.1.5 Reports</h4>
					<p>For now, we only support exporting editing sites information
						in text format. In the Directory Panel, right-click the probe list
						which you want to export, and select Show Sites List, Show Sites
						Distribution or Show Variant Distribution to make a report. Please
						see Probe Set and Probe Lists section for more details.</p>
					<h3 id="section2.2">2.2 Opening an Existing Project</h3>
					<p>To open an existing project, select ‘File > Open Project’
						from the main menu. All RED project files use a .red file
						extension. A RED project stores all of the Data Set, Data Group,
						Probe Set and Probe List information for your project. It also
						remembers which data tracks were visible. See Saving a Project
						section for more details.</p>
					<p>Although it stores the name of the genome you were using, it
						doesn't contain the actual genome data. If you are using RED on a
						new machine, it will automatically download and install the
						required genome when you open a project file. If you want to use
						RED when not connected to a network, you need to ensure that the
						correct genome has been installed locally. Once downloaded,
						genomes will be cached on your machine for future use.</p>
